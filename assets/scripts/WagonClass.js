// The Wagon class should set the following properties for each instance:

// a capacity, which must be provided to the constructor: this is the maximum number of passengers a wagon can hold.
// a passengers list, which is initially an empty array.
// The Wagon class should have these methods:

// getAvailableSeatCount() â€“ Returns the number of empty seats, determined by the capacity set when the wagon was created, subtracted by the number of passengers currently on board.
// join(traveler) - Adds the traveler to the wagon if there is space. If the wagon is already at maximum capacity, don't add them.
// shouldQuarantine() - Returns true if there is at least one unhealthy person in the wagon. Return false if not.
// totalFood() - Returns the total amount of food among all passengers in the wagon.
